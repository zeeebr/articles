# ArticlesApp

ArticlesApp is an application for collecting bibliographic data of organization employees in **Scopus** and **Web of Science** international citation database. The application recognizes the authorâ€™s affiliation with the department and the institute. The list of articles of the organization is maintained in a primitive form in Excel. To exclude manual data entry, the application processes an array of articles and exports data in an already existing table format for Excel.
